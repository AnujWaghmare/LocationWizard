    point = Point(lon, lat)  # Note: lon, lat order for Shapely
    
    # Seismic zone lookup
    seismic_match = seismic_gdf[seismic_gdf.contains(point)]
    zone = seismic_match.iloc[0]['zone'] if not seismic_match.empty else 'Unknown'
    
    # Wind speed lookup
    wind_match = wind_gdf[wind_gdf.contains(point)]
    wind_speed = wind_match.iloc[0]['Vb'] if not wind_match.empty else None
    
    return {
        'seismic_zone': zone,
        'basic_wind_speed': wind_speed,
        'zone_factor': zone_factors.get(zone)
    }
```

### 3.3 Performance Optimization
